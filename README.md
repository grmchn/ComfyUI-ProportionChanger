**Advanced DWPose-based body proportion manipulation and keypoint processing for ComfyUI**

This custom node is created by decomposing and copying the WanVideo UniAnimate DWPose Detector node from [kijai's ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper). The key difference is that instead of using image inputs, it now accepts DWPose KeyPoint data as input, enabling more flexible and detailed body proportion manipulation.

Transform body proportions, manipulate pose keypoints, and create more natural and consistent pose sequences through advanced proportion scaling algorithms.

## Features

### Core Nodes
- **ProportionChanger DWPose Detector**: Basic DWPose detection with keypoint output
- **ProportionChanger Reference**: Apply proportion changes from reference poses
- **ProportionChanger DWPose Render**: Pose visualization and rendering
- **ProportionChanger Params**: Interactive parameter control for pose adjustments
- **ProportionChanger Interpolator**: Frame interpolation for fluid motion
- **pose_keypoint input**: Utility for JSON to POSE_KEYPOINT conversion
- **pose_keypoint preview**: Utility for POSE_KEYPOINT to JSON conversion

### Key Capabilities
- **Proportion Manipulation**: Scale body parts (head, torso, limbs) independently
- **Reference-based Scaling**: Apply proportions from reference poses to target sequences
- **Format Conversion**: Seamless conversion between DWPose and POSE_KEYPOINT formats
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple frames and pose sequences efficiently
- **Interactive UI**: Real-time parameter adjustment with pose preview

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Load Image**: Input your source image
2. **DWPose Detection**: Use `ProportionChanger DWPose Detector` to extract pose keypoints
3. **Apply Proportions**: Use `ProportionChanger Reference` with reference pose for transformations
4. **Render Result**: Use `ProportionChanger DWPose Render` to visualize the final pose

### Advanced Features

#### Proportion Reference System
- Load a reference pose with desired proportions
- Apply those proportions to target images automatically
- Supports different canvas sizes with automatic scaling

#### Interactive Parameter Control
- `ProportionChanger Params` provides real-time adjustment
- Preview changes before applying to full sequences
- Fine-tune individual body part scaling
